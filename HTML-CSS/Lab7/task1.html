    <h2 title="This is the title of poem1">Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h2>
    <h3 title="This is the author of poem1">Shakespeare</h3>
    
    <pre title="This is the content of the poem1">But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st; <br>
Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade, <br>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st; <br>
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, <br>
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</pre>

<h2 title="This is the title of poem2">Let me not to the marriage of true minds</h2>
    <h3 title="This is the author of poem2">Shakespeare</h3>
    
    <p1 title="This is the content of the poem2">Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks <br>
Within his bending sickle’s compass come;<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p1>
