            <b>This website was created by Computer Science Group 16 at the <a href="https://le.ac.uk/">University of Leicester</a>, and its purpose is to teach visitors about computer processors considered to be significant in the history of computing.</b>

        <p>
            Computer processors have (quite literally) been at the <i>core</i> of the technological 
            revolution. From the first ever general purpose CPU, the Intel 4004, to the latest range of 
            high-performance modern CPUs like Ryzen and Intel i series, this site aims to explore every 
            significant computer processor in history.
            The evolution of computer processors has allowed manufacturers to develop and produce more 
            sophisticated and capable computers, exponentially expanding the possibilities of computation. 
            In a span of around 40 years, processors have evolved from simple 4-bit processing units to the 
            complex powerhouses we see today, which are used for gaming, word processing and so much more. 
            There have been many milestones in this journey from the primitive 4004 to the modern-day Ryzen 
            processors, and this website will allow you to explore the unique history behind each significant 
            processor in Computing History.

            While it would be quite the undertaking to compile a list of all the processors ever created 
            and their individual impacts on computing history, we have managed to create a list of what 
            we consider some of the most important processors in computing history, with a page describing 
            each unique processor, its development and the impact it had (or has) on the world of computing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every page of this website contains a detailed report with corresponding media detailing a 
            certain processor (or range of processors) and its impact on the computing world.
