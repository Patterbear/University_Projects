  <h2> The <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/">Apple M1</a> is the first ARM-based processor made by Apple made for the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini (2020).  It was announced and released in November 2020 and is the first generation of Apple MacBooks to transition from Intel to Apple processors. The Apple MacBooks and computers used to run Intel’s x86-64 chips since 2005 and have now started transitioning to the ARM64 architecture after 15 years. Apple first used ARM-architecture in 1993 for the Newton PDA. Recently Intel has slacked and allowed competitors such as AMD to thrive in the CPU marketplace with their release of AMD Ryzen providing better performance and much better value. AMD Ryzen was released 3 years ago, and intel failed to vastly improve products which allowed AMD to dominate the market. This most likely influenced Apple’s decision to step away from Intel and pursue its own ARM-based processor. Apple has designed and is currently using its own ARM-based chips for its other products such as the iPhone and iPad.

    The M1 chips are used with the new mac operating system Big Sur and have caused many app developers to make their apps universal to run efficiently for ARM architectures. Rosetta2 is included with Big Sur which allows applications to support x86-64 and ARM64 applications. This allows the use of programs that were made for previous mac generations that ran under intel. Rosetta2 is a type of x86 emulator which runs at up to 50-75% of native performance which is better than every other x86 emulator in the past. Rosetta also runs on 64-bit applications whereas most other x86 emulators do not.

    The CPU is an 8 core CPU running at max 3.2GHz clock speed. It is made of 4 high-performance cores and 4 efficient cores. The m1 chip broke headlines when announced due to its extremely impressive CPU performance as Apple claimed there was “Up to 3.5x faster CPU performance” and that the CPU is also extremely efficient as it has “3x higher performance per watt.” These announcements made by apple were not very specific and left critics sceptic but once the CPU was benchmarked it quickly became a real deal with its benchmarks beating previous intel MacBooks whilst reducing the price by around £400. This is a huge step in the right direction for Apple and shows the potential for the next M1 future generations have no boundaries.
