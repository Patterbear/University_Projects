        <h1><u>Significant Processors - Summary</u></h1>

            <b>Why did we choose CPUs for our project?</b> - CPUs have been instrumental in the evolution 
            of computing. Early machines like the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>
            's ENIAC required physical rewiring in order for different tasks to be conducted. When the first 
            stored-program computers were created, the first devices that be considered a CPU came with them. 
            A CPU itself is simply a device used to execute computer programs, and with the release of each 
            significant processor came a notable advance for computing as a whole.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We've come quite a way from the very basic CPUs used in the first stored-program computers, 
            with processors now capable of executing billions of instructions in mere seconds across 
            multiple cores.

            Each page in this website has been authored by an individual Informatics student at the 
            <a href="https://le.ac.uk">University of Leicester</a> and contains detailed information 
            and media on processors or ranges of processors that are considered to be signifcant in the 
            history of computing. On each page you will find facts, videos, pictures and audio relating 
            to the processor chosen by the student.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the processors (or processor ranges) detailed on this site have had their own very 
            remarkable impact on the world of computing, and without them the computing world as we 
            know it today may have looked very different.
