		<p><b>Ryzen is the brand name of AMD's latest -- and fastest -- family of computer processors
			<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/faqs/pc-life-faqs/amd2-ryzen/"><sup>[1]</sup></a></b>. 
			They are a range of 32 and 64 bit microprocessors designed, manufactured and marketed by 
			<a href="https://amd.com">Advanced Micro Devices</a> (or AMD) for desktop, mobile and embedded 
			systems. The design of the processors is derived from AMD's famous 
			<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/zen-core">Zen</a> microarchitecture.

		<p>Before Zen, AMD developed the <a href="https://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Bulldozer/index.html">
			Bulldozer</a> microarchitecture, which recieved such a poor reception upon its release that it 
			actually led to AMD abandoning their efforts to break into the high-end CPU market, which was being 
			dominated by Intel after the 2006 release of the revolutionary Core microarchitecture, built on 
			Intel's 65nm process technology<a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2006/03/10/the_new_intel_core_microarchitecture-1/"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
			Ryzen chips include several CPUs, APUs, and CPU families of various levels of potency

		<p>The Ryzen series was announced in December 2016 at AMD's New Horizon summit before the Ryzen 1000 
			series processors (A list of all 1000 series models can be found 
			<a href="https://www.littlebigpc.co.uk/components/processors/amd-cpus/amd-am4-ryzen-1000-series-cpu.html" target="_blank">here</a>) 
			were announced on February 22, 2017<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-release-date-news-and-features-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, 
			becoming commercially availible in March 2017. Since the release of the first generation of Ryzen 
			processors, AMD have produced and released another 4 generations of processors, with each generation 
			being more powerful and capable than the one before.

			AMD's next generation of Ryzen processors, the 6000 series, are rumoured to arrive in 2022
			<a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/amd-ryzen-6000-might-arrive-in-2022-as-the-worlds-first-6nm-desktop-processor"><sup>[5]</sup></a> 
			and are reportedly based on AMD's new Zen 3+ architecture. The new processors are said to be AMD's 
			first 6nm desktop APUs, with AMD's traditional <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/partner/amd-ryzen-radeon-vega">Vega</a> 
			built-in graphics being replaced by new 'Big Navi' integrated graphics, which will use 
			<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/rdna-2">RDNA 2</a> GPU architecture.
		</p>

		<p>
			Overall, the Ryzen processor range allowed AMD to cement their place in the high-end CPU market, finally bringing the company to the same level as its biggest rival, Intel. Ryzen processors have become commonplace in consumer systems, being known for their high-performance and reliability despite their cost on average being lest than Intel processors. With every new generation, AMD has introduced groundbreaking processors that cater to every consumer's needs. Whether it be a budget gaming system, a reliable workstation or a dedicated heavy-gaming rig, a Ryzen processor will do the job.
