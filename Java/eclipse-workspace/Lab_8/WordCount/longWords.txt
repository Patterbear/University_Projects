Space it says is big Really big
You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is 
I mean you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s but that’s just peanuts to space
It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes
All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe 
is a lot more complicated than you might think even if you start 
from a position of thinking it’s pretty damn complicated in the first place
Don't Panic
